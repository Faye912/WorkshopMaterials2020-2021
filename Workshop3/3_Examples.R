# Examples for Workshop 3

# Start by installing and loading your packages!
install.packages('tidyverse')
library(tidyverse)

# R (and some of its packages) have some data already
data("txhousing")
# For a dataframe native to R, find out more about the dataset by running
?txhousing

# Most of the time, you will need to load your own data in using the correct
# command for that datatype 
cps_df <- read.csv("Workshop3/cps.csv")

# Glancing at your data 


# Finding Summary Statistics


# Subsetting the Dataset


# Building New Variables
