# Practice Exercises for Workshop 3

# For many exercises, there are multiple ways to find a solution

# Load elections.tab 
# (Hint: ".tab" refers to a tab delimited file)

# This dataset contains two variables from elections for House races between 
# 1948 and 1998. It contains two variables "difdemshare" (which is the percentage
# of votes the Democratic candidate won minus the percentage that the Republican
# candidate won) and "demsharenext" (which is the percentage of votes that the
# Democratic candiate won in the next election)

# Find the mean and standard deviation of both variables 

# Construct an estimate for P(Dem won next election | Dem lost)
# (Hint: the expectation of an indicator variable is the probability that the 
# variable is one)

# Find the mean, standard deviation, and quintiles of demsharenext for elections 
# where the margin of victory was within 5%
